# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in kiss_cache! The project is authored by Jói Sigurdsson and copyright 2025 CrankWheel ehf.

## Open Source, Not Open Contribution

This project is **open source** and released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). You are free to:

- ✅ Use this code for any purpose (personal, commercial, etc.)
- ✅ Fork the repository and modify it for your own needs
- ✅ Create derivative works
- ✅ Distribute copies

However, **I am not accepting external contributions** at this time. This includes:

- ❌ Pull requests
- ❌ Feature requests
- ❌ Bug reports (unless they relate to security vulnerabilities)

## Why This Policy?

I want to keep this library simple and focused. Accepting external contributions requires significant maintenance overhead that I'm not planning to commit to at this time.

## If You Find a Security Vulnerability

Please report security issues responsibly by emailing security@crankwheel.com instead of opening a public issue.

## Alternatives

If you need features or changes that differ from our vision:
- **Fork the repository** - The MIT license allows you to create your own version
- **Use a different library** - There are many excellent caching libraries for Erlang/Elixir such as Cachex

## Questions?

For questions about using kiss_cache, please refer to the [README.md](README.md) documentation.
